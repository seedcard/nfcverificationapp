Upgraded version of SEEDCARD verification - a webapp that works with encoded NFC NTAG424 tags

Tag is built into the SEEDCARD and has a unique 14 character UID code encoded by the manufactuer - NXP

Every tag is encoded with the same redirect URL - https://seedcard.github.io/nfcverificationapp/index.html? (CHECK)

Link is opened and tag UID is read when the tag is placed near an NFC enabled device

The UID is cross-referenced with list of UID codes held in a JSON file

Verified UID can access link to wallet address to check BTC balance (this card is unfunded)

Example of verified UID - https://seedcard.github.io/nfcverificationapp/index.html?uid=0442157A4F1390

Unverified UID can click link to send email with UID code to seedcard team

Example of unverified UID - https://seedcard.github.io/nfcverificationapp/index.html?uid=0430167A4F1390

This app is work in progress - tap to scan of NFC tag is not working yet!
